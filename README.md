# Rubik’s Cube Coding Exercise

This program simulates a Rubik's cube. The aim of the program is not to solve the cube, just to develop a programmatic Rubik's cube that can correctly rotate any face.

The solution was developed using .NET Core (C#), you can use Visual Studio / Visual Studio Code to build and run the program.

- RubicsCube - the main project implementing the required Rubik's Cube rotations.
- RubiksCube.Tests - tests covering the required set of rotations.
